# Odin-CSS-Exercises
CSS foundation assignments:

For exercise 01, showing examples of the adding CSS to a HTML file. I added a div tag to the button element, rather than changing the background of the button itself, the background colour around the button was changed to orange, rectified this by removing the div tag and added the css styling within the button element.

Exercise 04 was skipped, this is that in previous exercises I was able to showcase in my CSS coding examples of chaining selectors.

With Exercise 05, the desired outcome of the "This should be unstyled" lines would be unaltered but since in exercise 1 includes an internal css type selector, I have added a class to this turning it into a class selector allowing for the desired outcome to remain.

With Exercise 6, I initially thought that all elements did not have unique selectors, hence why I created a link to another page. In actual fact this was not the case, but this did allow for me to work on skills previously learnt with linking pages and also learnt how to remove underlines from hyperlinks with the addition of text-decoration:none to the anchor element in the Exercise 6 button.
